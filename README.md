PubraSub.js
===========

A [pubsub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern)
implementation in a special way. This is extended with two extra methods - variations of publish.
*	_Request_ method : Publishes a message on a channel and waiting for any answer from any subscriber via a reverse channel
*	_Answer_ method : The dedicated way to publish an answer message to a request

This project is evolved from an original pubsub implementation by [Federico Lox](https://github.com/federico-lox/),
who also refactored other's work, like [Daniel Lamb](http://daniellmb.com).
